class Matcher:
    """
    This class assigns to each predicted "element" (e.g., a box) a ground-truth
    element. Each predicted element will have exactly zero or one matches; each
    ground-truth element may be assigned to zero or more predicted elements.

    Matching is based on the MxN match_quality_matrix, that characterizes how well
    each (ground-truth, predicted)-pair match. For example, if the elements are
    boxes, the matrix may contain box IoU overlap values.

    The matcher returns a tensor of size N containing the index of the ground-truth
    element m that matches to prediction n. If there is no match, a negative value
    is returned.
